For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, WTSUPP, or EARNWT. 

HWTFINL generally has the same value as WTFINL for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTFINL; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988.]]></txt>

CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH).

When analyzing ASEC data, researchers should use the person weight ASECWT. For analyses including the variables EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION, researchers should use the EARNWT variable. 

WTFINL is the second stage weight in CPS (see technical documentation). It is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; adjustments to the known distribution of the entire population according to stage, age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity; and allotting a weight of zero to populations not sampled in other monthly surveys (i.e., persons in the Hispanic oversample and members of the armed forces in ASEC samples).]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0.

  <labl>Validated Longitudinal Identifier</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDV is an IPUMS CPS-created variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. In addition to linking records across the CPS 4-8-4 rotation pattern, CPSIDV only makes links between those records whose SEX and RACE values do not change and whose AGE values change in expected ways over time. 

CPSIDV is based on CPSIDP and so there are some structural similarities between them. The first six digits of CPSIDV are identical to CPSIDP - the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. Like CPSIDP, CPSIDV allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern. 

Only records that link using CPSIDP that also have consistent race and sex values and age values that increase at least one but not more than two years over the course of the 16-month CPS rotation are linkable using CPSIDV. As a result, linkage rates using CPSIDV are slightly lower than those achieved using CPSIDP. However, linkages created with CPSIDV do not require the recommended post-linking verification steps recommended for use with CPSIDP links. Users should note that original, unharmonized values of age, sex, and race are used in the creation of CPSIDV. The procedure and validation criteria for creating CPSIDV are described in detail in A Holistic Approach to Validating Current Population Survey Panel Data. 

CPSIDV may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDV, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDV and MISH to create a person-time file.

  <labl>Weekly earnings (rounded)</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EARNWEEK2 reports how much the respondent usually earned per week at their current job, before deductions, rounded to preserve privacy. In April 2023, the Census Bureau began rounding weekly earnings as a privacy protection measure. EARNWEEK2 imposes these rounding criteria on pre-April 2023 data (including the 2023 ASEC) to provide users with comparable weekly earnings over time. See the Census Bureau's user note for more information on the new privacy protection measures. EARNWEEK reports un-rounded weekly earnings for pre-April 2023 data (including the 2023 ASEC) only.

Note that rounding of earnings is part of a set of changes made to preserve respondent privacy that began to be phased in with the MISH group in January of 2023. April of 2023 is the first month in which this MISH group is asked earnings questions. Because of Census Bureau's phased approach to introducing these privacy protection measures, only MISH 4 groups in April 2023 - March of 2024 Basic Monthly samples are rounded and topcoded by the Census Bureau. In these months, IPUMS applies the new rounding rules to the MISH 8 group so that all records have comparable values within months. Users wishing to access a variable in which MISH 4 is rounded and MISH 8 remains unrounded should use UH_ERNWK_B5.

Respondents reporting earnings between $0.01 and $7 have weekly earnings set at $4. Those who report $7.01-$1,199.00 have their weekly earnings values rounded to the nearest $2. Weekly earnings between $1,199.01 and $1,999.00 are rounded to the nearest $10. Finally, weekly earnings at or above $2,000.00 are rounded to the nearest $20. For further information about the changes to earnings data beginning in April 2023 and rounding examples, see the Census Bureau's user note.

Interviewers asked directly about total weekly earnings and collected information about the usual number of hours worked per week and the hourly rate of pay at the current job. The figure given in EARNWEEK2 is the higher of the values derived from these two sources: 1) the respondent's answer to the question, "How much do you usually earn per week at this job before deductions?" or 2) for workers paid by the hour (and coded as "2" in PAIDHOUR), the reported number of hours the respondent usually worked at the job, multiplied by the hourly wage rate given in HOURWAGE, and rounded as described above.

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer, users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors. Researchers should use the EARNWT weight with this variable.

  <txt><![CDATA[HOURWAGE2 reports how much the respondent earned per hour in the current job, for those workers paid an hourly wage (and coded as "2" in PAIDHOUR).  Beginning in April 2023, hourly earnings were rounded and topcodes were changed as a privacy protection measure. HOURWAGE2 imposes these criteria on pre-April 2023 data (including the 2023 ASEC) to provide users with comparable hourly earnings over time. See the Census Bureau's user note for more information on the new privacy protection measures. HOURWAGE reports un-rounded hourly earnings for pre-April 2023 data (including the 2023 ASEC) only.

Note that rounding of earnings is part of a set of changes made to preserve respondent privacy that began to be phased in with the MISH 1 group in January of 2023. April of 2023 is the first month in which this MISH group is asked earnings questions. Because of Census Bureau's phased approach to introducing these privacy protection measures, only MISH 4 groups in April 2023 - March of 2024 Basic Monthly samples are rounded and topcoded by the Census Bureau. In these months, IPUMS applies the new rounding rules to the MISH 8 group so that all records have comparable values within months. Users wishing to access a variable in which MISH 4 is rounded and MISH 8 remains unrounded should use UH_ERNHR_B2.

Those reporting hourly earnings between $0.01 and $0.07 are set to $0.05; hourly earnings between $0.08 and $29.99 are rounded to the nearest $0.05; hourly earnings between $30.00 and $49.99 are rounded to the nearest $0.25; hourly earnings $50.00 or higher are rounded to the nearest $0.50. For further information about the changes to earnings data beginning in April 2023 and rounding examples, see the Census Bureau's user note.

With the new rounding scheme, it is no longer possible to identify which persons are earning less than the Federal minimum wage using hourly earnings. To preserve this information, the new variable SUBMINWAGE has been introduced to flag these individuals.

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer with rounding applied as described above; users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.  Researchers should use the EARNWT weight with this variable.

Users should note that HOURWAGE2 has two implied decimal places. The command files provided by IPUMS divide HOURWAGE2 by 100, so no further alteration is necessary.

  <labl>Employment status</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. The variable also provides information on the activity (e.g., doing housework, attending school,) or status (e.g., retired, unable to work) of persons not in the labor force, as well as limited additional information on those who are in the labor force (e.g. members of the Armed Forces, those with a job, but not at work last week). See LABFORCE for a dichotomous variable identifying whether a person participated in the labor force.

In the CPS, individuals' employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week.  Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work."  Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "has job, not at work last week."

Because the CPS is designed to measure unemployment in the civilian population, the original employment status variable in the survey classifies members of the armed forces as NIU (Not in universe).

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force.  Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and either reported looking for work as their major activity during the previous week (for 1962 through 1993) or answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. A separate CPS variable specifying whether an unemployed person had worked before or was looking for a first job was used to distinguish between "experienced" and "inexperienced" unemployed persons in IPUMS CPS.

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force."  Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[OCC reports the person's primary occupation.  Respondents who held more than one job were to report the job at which they worked the largest number of hours.  For persons who were employed at the time of the survey, OCC relates to the job worked during the preceding week; unemployed persons and those not currently in the labor force were to give their most recent occupation.   The CPS interviewer collected information by asking what kind of work the person was doing, and Census Bureau staff coded the information into the contemporary CPS or census occupational classification.  Researchers who wish to work with a consistent occupational coding scheme for 1968 forward should use the OCC1950 variable.  For general discussion of employment concepts, including the definition of those not in the labor force, see the documentation on EMPSTAT.]]></txt>

  <labl>Earnings weight</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EARNWT is a person-level weight that should be used in any analysis including one of the following variables: EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, UNION, UHRSWORKORG, WKSWORKORG, ELIGORG, and OTPAY. For any other analysis using ASEC data, researchers should use ASECWT or for analyses of non-ASEC data, WTFINL.

Individuals in the 6 rotation groups that were not asked the "earner study" questions (covering EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, UNION, UHRSWORKORG, WKSWORKORG, ELIGORG, and OTPAY) have a value of zero for EARNWT. Even in the 2 rotation groups where "earner study" questions were fielded, members of the armed forces have a value of zero for EARNWT.  

According to 
  Technical Paper 66
, issued jointly by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals eligible for the earner study are civilians age 15 and older in rotation groups 4 or 8 who are not self-employed. In the data itself, this is true in all samples up to and including those in 1997. From 1998 to 2010, only individuals age 16 and older in rotation groups 4 or 8, and are not self-employed, are in universe for this variable. This universe also applies to basic monthly samples after 2010. In ASEC samples after 2010, the data reflect the published universe.

In any given month, approximately 1/4 of the CPS sample is in the earner study and each household should appear in the earner study exactly twice. Based on documentation from Unicon and  NBER, and after an inspection of the original CPS data, we recommend that users impose the CPS eligibility restrictions in any analyses of earner study variables.]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesEARNWT is an 8-digit numeric variable with four implied decimals.  That is, 12345678 should be interpreted as 1234.5678.  The IPUMS command files automatically divide EARNWT by 10000, so no further adjustment is needed.]]></codInstr>
